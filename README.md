Florida Legislature Passes Extreme Anti-Trans Bathroom Bill and Gender-Affirming Care Ban in an Egregious Assault on Parental Rights

## The Message

### > Forcing transgender children away from their parents is a form of violence and is an affront to human rights. It also serves no constructive purpose, as removing transgender children from their family homes will only cause them further trauma and make it harder for them to access the resources they need to thrive. Allowing the state of Florida to kidnap transgender children from their parents is not only inhumane, but it also stands in violation of key human rights, such as the right to family life, the right to freedom of expression, and the right to consent to medical procedures. It is an unacceptable intrusion on people's lives, and it must be stopped.
